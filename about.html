                    My name is Kathir Karunamurthy, and I love sports like basketball, and I love computer science and coding. Along with this, I love food, especially really spicy food.

                    The restaurant has been a family business since our family moved to the US in 1970 and was passed down through the family, being named after whoever owned it. I loved the foods we sold, but sales were bad and the restaurant almost closed.

                    I passionately loved spicy food, so in 2020, I decided to remake the store by  selling extremely spicy versions of my favorite foods from the restaurant along with the original menu. Business boomed with the early use of social media, and now we have 100 stores across the US.
